# Dynamic DNS for Directadmin
Want to attach your home server to a subdomain but don't know how?
Use this either of these scripts with a cronjob to dynamically update your DNS records!

## PHP Setup
ssh to your home server and make sure deps are installed, such as `php php-curl`.

```
# git clone https://github.com/shoaloak/DirectAdmin-DDNS /opt/dyndns
# vi /opt/dyndns/credentials.json
# cat /opt/dyndns/credentials.json
{
	"username": "myusername",
	"password": "mypassword",
	"hostname": "webXXXX.zxcs.nl",
	"domain": "mydomain.com",
	"subdomain": "mysubdomain"
}
# whereis php # <php location>, usually /usr/bin/php
# crontab -e
* * * * * <php location> /opt/dyndns/dyndns.php
```

## Python
Almost same as PHP: `python3 dyndns.py`. Might need `pip install requests`.
